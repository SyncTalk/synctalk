Meditation

Be quiet and more discreet, O my Grief.
You cried out for the Evening; even now it falls:
A gloomy atmosphere envelops the city,
Bringing peace to some, anxiety to others.
 
While the vulgar herd of mortals, under the scourge
Of Pleasure, that merciless torturer,
Goes to gather remorse in the servile festival,
My Grief, give me your hand; come this way
 
Far from them. See the dead years in old-fashioned gowns
Lean over the balconies of heaven; Smiling
Regret rise from the depths of the waters;
 
The dying Sun fall asleep beneath an arch, and
Listen, darling, to the soft footfalls of the Night
That traits off to the East like a long winding-sheet.
