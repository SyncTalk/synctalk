Chapter 1 When I was only six years old, I saw a wonderful illustration in a book called "True Stories" about primitive forests. It showed a python devouring a big beast.
At the top of the page is a copy of the painting.
The book states: "These pythons swallow their prey whole without chewing it, and then cannot move again; they digest the food during a long six-month sleep."
At that time, I thought a lot about the adventures in the jungle, so I also drew my first picture with colored pencils.
My number one piece.
It goes like this: I showed this masterpiece of mine to the adults, and I asked them if my painting frightened them.
They answered me: "What's so terrible about a hat?"
What I drew was not a hat, but a python digesting an elephant.
So I drew the situation inside the python's belly so that adults can understand it.
These adults always have something to explain.
My second work is as follows: The adults advised me to put aside these pictures of boas with open or closed bellies and focus on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar.
In this way, at the age of six, I gave up this wonderful career of being a painter.
The failure of my first and second works made me discouraged.
These grown-ups can't understand anything on their own, and they have to be constantly having to explain things to them.
This is really boring for the children.
Later, I had no choice but to choose another career. I learned to fly airplanes and have flown to almost all parts of the world.
Indeed, geography helped me a lot.
I can tell the difference between China and Arizona at a glance.
This is useful if you lose your way at night.
In this way, I have had many contacts with many serious people in my life.
I have lived among adults for a long time.
I watched them carefully, but it didn't change my opinion of them much.
When I meet an adult who seems to have a slightly clear mind, I take out my first work that I have saved and test him.
I wonder if he really has the ability to understand.
But the answer is always: "This is a hat."
I won't talk to him about giant pythons, virgin forests, or anything like that.
I had to adapt to their level and talk to them about bridge, golf, politics, ties and so on.
So the adults were very happy to meet a reasonable person like me.
